# Real Estate Price Prediction using Linear Regression and Web Development

This project aims to provide accurate predictions for house prices in Bangalore by merging the fields of Data Science and Web Development. The core of the project involves implementing a machine learning model based on Linear Regression to estimate house prices, and then presenting these predictions through a web interface built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project utilizes a dataset comprising over 10,000 rows of real estate data to train and test the machine learning model.

## Introduction
The real estate price prediction project combines the expertise of Data Science and Web Development to provide accurate estimates of house prices in Bangalore. By leveraging a Linear Regression machine learning model and an interactive web interface, users can obtain valuable insights into the real estate market.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression is utilized for training and testing the price prediction model.
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are employed to create a user-friendly and informative web interface.
- **Python Libraries**: Various libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn are used for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning model implementation.

## Dataset
The project employs a comprehensive dataset comprising more than 10,000 rows of real estate data from Bangalore. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning model's performance.

## Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model employs Linear Regression to predict house prices based on various features present in the dataset. The model is trained on a subset of the dataset and then tested for accuracy. This trained model forms the backend of the web application.

## Web Interface
The web interface is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input relevant property features, and upon submission, the web interface communicates with the trained machine learning model to provide an estimated price for the property. The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.

## Usage
Users can access the web interface through a browser. They input the relevant details of the property they are interested in, and the interface returns an estimated price based on the machine learning model's predictions.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-price-prediction.git](https://github.com/JamesUdy/RE_Price_Prediction.git)`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd real-estate-price-prediction`
